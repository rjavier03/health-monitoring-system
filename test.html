<p>For the best possible game development experience, Hero Time has created A QUICKSTART GUIDE TO MAKING A BOARD GAME which provides a step by step checklist for your game design and publication. 
</p>
    <p>The checklist covers game development from start to finish: brainstorming, playtesting, manufacturing, marketing and sales. Each step is crucial to your game’s development and will also save you time and money. 
    </p>
<h2>GAME PLAY & DESIGN</h2>

<p>>What type of game do you want to make? A fast-paced card game or a lengthy strategic board game? This is an important aspect not only from the look of the game, but also what you want the players to experience. 
</p>
<p>In our section on Game Play and Design, Hero time will guide you through brainstorming game play ideas such as game pieces, cards, boards, and even help create the rules of your game. We also cover proofing and sampling your game before mass production which are both highly beneficial for scheduling release dates and budgeting for final costs.
</p>
<h2></h2>ARTWORK STAGE</h2>

<p>Do you want your game artwork to stand out on the shelf? Of course! It’s similar to the cover of a book or a music album…if it looks cool, a customer is more likely to pick it up and make the purchase. Hero Time offers an impressive selection of artists which can help your visual dream become board game reality. 
</p>
    <p>Board game artwork not only covers the game box, but also the board, pieces, cards, and even the rule book. But don’t fret, our checklist will guide you through this phase by discussing the best options to make your game look amazing while staying within your budget. This is a key part of development, so make sure to reach out to us for Creator Assistance.
    </p>
<h2>MANUFACTURING & LOGISTICS</h2>

<p>Now that the creative process is complete the game production can begin! Hero Time’s Creator Assistant will help finalize the last details before printing such as safety regulation labels, standardized testing, and uploading all finished artwork into our art team’s cloud. Once these final steps are completed, your game goes into production!
</p>
    <p>No matter what size your game order, Hero Time can ship the final product to any location domestic or international. For larger orders, Hero Time can send direct to your warehouses. For smaller orders, we can send your game right to your doorstep. It’s that easy!
    </p>
<h2>MARKETING & SELLING</h2>

<p>Your art is amazing, your game is boxed and ready, now let’s make you some money! Hero Time’s fundamental checklist for marketing will help narrow your ad campaign and focus it on the customers most likely to purchase your creation. We provide consulting on website design, marketing campaigns, and even social media advertising. 
</p>
<h2>CROWDFUNDING</h2>
<p>
Many people see crowdfunding as free money they can get for their idea before they even invested in their game. However, this cannot be farther from the truth. 
</p><p>
Promoting a crowdfunding page successfully requires a much larger investment than promoting your own website and game. On average campaigns of up to $30,000 USD spend around $6,000 USD on advertising and building the infrastructure around their project. It is important to note that, with this investment, income is not guaranteed even if it funds successfully. (In contrast to regular channels where you at least generate sales and some revenue). If your game is well-budgeted and you believe your idea, it is far easier and less risky to self-finance your game.Hence, crowdfunding is not for everyone nor for every game. Hero Time’s marketing checklist to start generating consistent income from your exciting new board game! 
</p><p>
To summarize, Hero Time offers customers step-by-step guidance through each phase of game development: Design, Artwork, Manufacturing, Shipping, and Marketing. We won’t lie, there’s a lot to do and many specific requirements, but think of all the other games out there that never made it pass the drawing board. Hero Time is committed to your success and getting your board game dream onto gamer tables around the world
